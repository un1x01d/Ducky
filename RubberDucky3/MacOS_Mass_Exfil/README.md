# README: Data Exfiltration Script

## **Overview**  
This script is a data collection and exfiltration tool designed to run on a macOS system. It gathers various types of sensitive information and stores them in hidden directories before compressing them for potential extraction. The script is intended to run stealthily in the background.

---

## **Setup and Execution**  
### **Prerequisites:**  
- The script is designed to run on macOS.  
- Ensure the script has execution permissions:  

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### **Execution:**  
Run the script in the background:  

```bash
./script.sh &
```

## **Security Implications**  
This script is highly malicious and can be used for:  
- **Data theft**: Exfiltrates sensitive files and credentials.  
- **Network reconnaissance**: Gathers network details for potential further attacks.  
- **Credential theft**: Steals SSH keys, GPG keys, and browser session data.

## **Detection and Prevention**  
### **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**  
- Hidden directories: `~/.sys` and `~/.s`.  
- A compressed zip file: `.l.oo.t.zip`.  
- Wiped shell history (`~/.zsh_history`).  

### **Prevention Tips:**  
- Regularly monitor your home directory for hidden folders.  
- Use file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes.  
- Limit access to SSH keys and sensitive files.  
- Enable logging to monitor suspicious shell commands.
